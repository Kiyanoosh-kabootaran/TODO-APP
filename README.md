# ✨ App Features (Based on Code Logic)

* ### **Add New Task with Date**
  #### Users can type a task and select a due date. When clicking the plus button, the task is stored and displayed in the To-Do section.

* ### **LocalStorage Persistence**
  #### All tasks (both To-Do and Done) are saved in localStorage, so the list remains even after refreshing or closing the browser.

* ### **Mark Task as Done**
  #### Clicking the tick button removes the task from the To-Do list and pushes it to the Tasks Done section, where it appears with strikethrough.

* ### **Delete To-Do Task**
  #### Clicking the trash icon on a To-Do task removes it permanently from the list.

* ### **Delete Completed Task**
  #### Completed tasks (in the Tasks Done section) also have a delete button to remove them permanently.

* ### **Collapsible Done Section**
  #### The Done tasks panel can be toggled open/closed via the button inside (.tasks-done-flex), allowing users to hide or show completed tasks.
